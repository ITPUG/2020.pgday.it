###### **Why**

Many benefits result from participating in the [PGDay.IT 2019](https://2019.pgday.it/en/){:target="_blank"}: acquisition of know-how that can be shared with colleagues, opportunities for discussion with participants and speakers, the possibility of resolving existing technical problems, achieving objectives quickly and consciously.

The most important note is the economic advantage in the adoption of PostgreSQL within companies, in order to reduce the licensing costs that prevent them from investing in research and development, allowing companies to be more competitive on the market.

It is worth remembering that the adoption of [PostgreSQL is growing strongly!](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend){:target="_blank"}!

###### **Who**

The [PGDay.IT](https://www.itpug.org/pgday/){:target="_blank"} is a national annual event and is organised by [ITPUG - Italian PostgreSQL Users Group](https://www.itpug.org/){:target="_blank"}, a non-profit association for the promotion, dissemination and protection of Free Software (FLOSS) in Italy.

In particular, the [ITPUG](https://www.itpug.org/about/){:target="_blank"} association promotes the adoption of PostgreSQL, which is one of the most successful open source projects.

[New members](https://www.itpug.org/subscribe/){:target="_blank"} are always welcome!

Please send an email to [pgday@itpug.org](mailto:pgday@itpug.org) or use the live chat of the website of [PGDay.IT 2019](https://2019.pgday.it/it/){:target="_blank"}.

Good PostgreSQL to everyone! See you in Bologna on May 16th and 17th.
