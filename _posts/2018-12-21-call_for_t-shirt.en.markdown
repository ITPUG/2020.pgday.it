###### Create the T-shirt of the 13th Edition of PGDay.IT!

Great news for the [2019 edition of the PGDay.IT](https://2019.pgday.it/it/): **"Create the T-shirt!" contest.**

Do you have ideas about the message to be transmitted? Do you want a really cool T-shirt as never seen before? Do you want to leave a personal mark on this year’s edition?
Do you have graphic design skills and do you want to create the design or even draw it yourself?

Follow these few rules and send us your proposal:

* Black t-shirt
* Drawing / writing in white (single colour)
* ITPUG logo on the left sleeve
* No logos of Partners / Sponsors

The Organizing Committee of PGDay.IT 2019 will select one of the proposals, which will be drawn up by a professional graphic designer in agreement with the creator, who will also be able to have his signature on the t-shirt.
