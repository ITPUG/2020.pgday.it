If you belong to any of those groups, you are invited to submit a workshop proposal (or proposals). The designated technical committee will evaluate the proposals and select the workshops. It could be yours!

###### Topics and Arguments - What do we expect?

The [last edition](https://2018.pgday.it/en/workshop/) saw a strong participation in the workshops, which came together with great feedback. We have received many requests to repeat the Workshop Day on this 2019 edition too.

These are some of the topics that we have thought, but you can send your proposal even if itâ€™s about a subject that is not listed here.

* High Availability
* Disaster Recovery
* Performance Tuning and Optimization
* Troubleshooting
* Writing PostgreSQL extensions
* PostgreSQL database design best practices
* PostgreSQL application development
