<h6>PGDay.IT 2020 opens the doors.</h6>

We are full of enthusiasm because the [last edition](https://2020.pgday.it/en/) has been fantastic!
More than 160 enthusiastic attendees, interesting talks, great speakers, fantastic partners, and a beautiful location. We have also received very positive feedback from the participants!

We couldn't have asked for a better result.
Thanks to everybody: attendees, speakers, staff, and partners. We hope to meet you again during this new edition of [PGDay.IT](https://2020.pgday.it/en/).

[PGDay.IT 2020](https://2020.pgday.it/en/) will be held in [Bergamo](https://www.visitbergamo.net/it/news/notizia/161/) on June 11th and 12th, 2020.

The chosen location is [Centro Congressi Giovanni XXIII](https://www.centrocongressibergamo.com/). The Giovanni XXIII Congress Center is located in the heart of the city of Bergamo and enjoys a privileged location thanks to its proximity to [Bergamo-Orio al Serio](https://www.milanbergamoairport.it/en/) (5km) and the [railway station](https://www.thetrainline.com/en/stations/bergamo) (300 meters); a few steps from the location you can find 4-star hotels, the shopping streets, the [Venetian Walls of the Upper Town](https://www.visitbergamo.net/en/object-details/2979-mura-veneziane/) recognized as a UNESCO heritage site, a parking area dedicated to speakers and a large parking lot with special rates for participants.

How is the conference structured?

**June 12th** will be held the **Conference** with keynote, talks in Italian, talks in English, and the lightning talks.

**June 11th** will be held the **Workshop Day**. Four hours dedicated to specific topics chosen among the proposals that we will receive. The 2018 and 2019 editions have received so many inscriptions and praises from those who have participated.

Focus points:
* Attendees: we are expecting so many… a lot of people, actually!
* Topics: many hours dedicated entirely to PostgreSQL, lots of talks with high technical content, and the community experience that cannot be missed.
* When: Conference June 12th, 2020 - Workshop Day June 11th, 2020.
* Speakers: The [Call for Papers is open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfruHdXMvxIuEuH0glSf1S-vUGEQt68v9Y-xBp0nxXnvEXPjA/viewform) and we expect many interesting proposals. The Keynote Speaker will be a fantastic surprise for every one.
