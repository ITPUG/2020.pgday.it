Every year, in any country in the world and at any latitude, conferences, meetups and other events dedicated to Open Source and [in particular to PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/events/) are organized.

These events play a fundamental role from the point of view of the dissemination and sharing of the news and opportunities that this reality offers.

It is within such an event that PostgreSQL and its Ecosystem have the opportunity to come into contact with a wider catchment area, and it is always thanks to these events that companies have the opportunity to develop a strategic medium/long term plan based on the news presented during a PGconf or a PGday.

We all know that a strategy based on Open Source products allows companies to be increasingly competitive on the reference market.

Although it is true that digital technology allows us to be everywhere without moving from our city, to acquire information at an impressive speed, today more than ever there is a strong need for direct confrontation, exchange of experiences and, sharing of ideas.

This is the reason for the strong participation and interest in events such as the PGDays and the PGConf.

For our [ITPUG](https://www.itpug.org/) association, PGDay.IT is ** an unmissable appointment! **

It is certainly a fundamental opportunity to highlight the strengths of PostgreSQL and Open Source, but not only!

It is a moment of sharing, it is a friends reunion, it is an opportunity to expand our network. And, why not, the opportunity to be amazed at how far we have gone together.

Of course, we're biased, it doesn't count.
Well then tell us your point of view!

#### Why participate to the PGDay.IT 2020?

We would be delighted to receive your comments in order to publish them in this post. Send your opinions, your experiences to [pgday@itpug.org](mailto:pgday@itpug.org) and we will be happy to publish them without censorship.
